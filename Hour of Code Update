Just wanted to add a new branch to better teach myself how to use GitHub.

Quick update on hour of code - Raffle is going great, I plan to use extra coffee cart card by giving them to the Hour of Code staff as a thank you.

Speaker is still comming in on Friday (as of 4th period on Thursday)

People seem to be enjoying the Hour of Code.
